This package provides native bindings to [libtorrent rastebar](http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/) as a [Node.js addon](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/addons.html).

It's a fork of https://github.com/fanatid/node-libtorrent which incorporates few fixes and enhancements from various
contributors and which was ported to [NANÂ²](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) to allow usage across all versions of node.js
(NAN claims to support all major versions).

Please report any issues you find while running this code. Feel free to open a PR as well.
