# node-libtorrent-ng

#### node-libtorrent New Generation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lyssdod/node-libtorrent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lyssdod/node-libtorrent)

node-libtorrent provides native bindings to [libtorrent rastebar](http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/) as a [Node.js addon](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/addons.html).

This is a fork of https://github.com/fanatid/node-libtorrent which incorporates few fixes from various
contributors and which was ported to NANÂ² to allow its usage across all versions of node.js
(NAN claims to support all major versions).

Please report any issues you find while running this code. Feel free to open a PR as well.
